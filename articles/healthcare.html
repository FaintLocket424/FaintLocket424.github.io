              Technology has undoubtadly had a huge effect on healthcare. From
              complex medical devices like MRI scanners, to patient record
              databases, it is clear that computers have an enormous role in
              today's medical services.
              <br /><br />
              There is, however, an emerging use of technology in healthcare,
              which you might not know is actually in use today!

            <a href="https://www.flyzipline.com">Zipline</a> is a logistics
            company who are aiming to bring drone delivery to the masses. While
            their marketing focusses heavily on food, grocery and other domestic
            deliveries, the real potential in this technology lies in improving
            logistics in healthcare. Zipline have been using their drones to
            deliver blood, vaccines and other time-critical medicine to remote
            hospitals and medical centres in Rwanda since 2016, and have
            recently expended into many other developing countries, plus some
            locations in Japan and the US. <br /><br />

            Additionally, zipline claims their drones produce 97% less emissions
            per journey than a car, so would be a much faster and eco-friendly
            alternative to the current food delivery services such as Deliveroo
            and Uber Eats.
            <br /><br />
            Youtuber Mark Rober covered this organisation in a video (embedded
            in this page) to raise awareness of the technology. Zipline proves
            that drone delivery is possible, practical and has the potential to
            transform the way we live our lives for the better.
