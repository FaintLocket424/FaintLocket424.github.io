    <h1>AI in Marine Biology</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>However</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now being used in marine biology
      research to observe marine life. Cameras, sonar, sensors and other
      equipment are laden with AI. The algorithms count the fish and plankton,
      monitor the size of the fish, and can even distinguish one fish from
      another. The use of AI is new to marine biologists, yet Halvorsen
      considers what he and his colleagues are doing with the help of AI along
      the coast of southern Norway a ‘revolution’. “Observing and counting fish
      used to be manual tasks, where we had to comb through hours of film
      footage to find the information we were looking for,” explained Halvorsen.
      “Just measuring the length of a cod requires a picture where the front and
      back parts of the fish are clearly visible. The work is very time
      consuming. With artificial intelligence, taking observations is automated.
      We get the number of different fish species, sizes and other observations
      immediately.”
