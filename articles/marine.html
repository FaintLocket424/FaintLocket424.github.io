      <strong> For decades,</strong> marine mammal researchers have been using
      increasingly sophisticated tags to track animals and record their
      movements and diving behavior, capture video, and even record
      physiological data such as heart rates. Kendall-Bar‚Äôs thesis research
      explores new techniques for monitoring sleep in wild marine mammals. In
      2019, she offered to do an animation for a researcher whose presentation
      on humpback whale feeding behavior she had seen at a scientific
      conference. ‚ÄúHe had a spectacular video of three whales feeding
      cooperatively at the bottom of the sea, but it was really difficult to see
      what they were doing,‚Äù she recalled. ‚ÄúThe talk generated a huge amount of
      interest at the conference, with hundreds of people squinting and craning
      their necks to decipher what was happening in the video.‚Äù The animation
      she produced for the whale researcher, NOAA scientist David Wiley at the
      Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, not only shows the humpback
      feeding behavior more clearly than the video did, it also includes a
      simulated school of prey fish with scientifically accurate behavior, and
      shows how ropeless technology for lobster traps can reduce the risk of
      whale

    <p style="text-indent: 20px; margin: 1%">
      <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> is now being used in
      marine biology research to observe marine life. Cameras, sonar, sensors
      and other equipment are laden with AI. The algorithms count the fish and
      plankton, monitor the size of the fish, and can even distinguish one fish
      from another. The use of AI is new to marine biologists, yet Halvorsen
      considers what he and his colleagues are doing with the help of AI along
      the coast of southern Norway a ‚Äòrevolution‚Äô. ‚ÄúObserving and counting fish
      used to be manual tasks, where we had to comb through hours of film
      footage to find the information we were looking for,‚Äù explained Halvorsen.
      ‚ÄúJust measuring the length of a cod requires a picture where the front and
      back parts of the fish are clearly visible. The work is very time
      consuming. With artificial intelligence, taking observations is automated.
      We get the number of different fish species, sizes and other
